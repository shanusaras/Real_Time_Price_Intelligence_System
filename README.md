## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your configuration
5. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   python backend/models/database.py
   ```
6. Start the API server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn backend.api.main:app --reload
   ```

## Data Pipeline

The data pipeline uses Apache Airflow to:
1. Extract data from various sources
2. Transform and clean the data
3. Load processed data into the database
4. Generate analytics and insights

## Analytics Features

- Price trend analysis
- Seasonal patterns detection
- Competitor price comparison
- Demand forecasting
- Market positioning analysis
