# 🛒 Real-Time Price Intelligence System

A scalable, end-to-end simulation of a real-world **Price Intelligence System** for e-commerce, powered by clean pipelines, structured data, and business-aligned insights.

---

## 🚧 Project Status: Phase 1 Complete

**✔ 20,000+ products scraped**  
**✔ Robust data pipeline built**  
**✔ Business-driven categorization logic applied**  
➡️ *Next: EDA, ML modeling, real-time dashboard, deployment*

---

## 📦 Project Summary

In e-commerce, pricing strategy is critical — it directly affects revenue, profit margins, and market competitiveness. This project builds the foundation of a system that helps businesses:

- Continuously **track competitor pricing**
- **Analyze price trends**
- Optimize pricing using **ML-based recommendations**

---

## 🔁 Phase 1: Scalable Data Collection Pipeline

To simulate real-world scale:

- ✅ Scraped **20,000+ products** using the [Open Food Facts API](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data)
- ✅ Covered **15 major categories × 120+ pages**
- ✅ Generated structured data in **JSON + CSV** formats

### ⚙️ Pipeline Features:

- Retry logic with **exponential backoff**
- Rate-limiting to avoid IP bans
- Logging + fault tolerance
- **Post-scraping categorization** using business keywords:
  - Snacks
  - Beverages
  - Dairy
  - Personal Care
  - Health Supplements

### 🧠 Why Open Food Facts?

Attempted Flipkart scraping but faced heavy anti-bot protection. Pivoted to Open Food Facts — an open-source, ethical, large-scale API ideal for simulation.
