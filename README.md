- **Business Value:** Provides at-a-glance business health metrics for the product catalog.
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  curl "http://localhost:8000/analytics/summary"
  ```

All endpoints use the latest, deduplicated data for accuracy.

## 📦 Project Summary

In e-commerce, pricing strategy is critical — it directly affects revenue, profit margins, and market competitiveness. This project builds the foundation of a system that helps businesses:
- Continuously **track competitor product prices** on Jumia
- **Capture detailed product metadata** (title, brand, price, discount, rating, reviews, availability)
- Optimize pricing and promotional strategies using **data-driven insights**

---

## 🔁 Phase 1: Scalable Data Collection Pipeline

To collect rich pricing data at scale:
- ✅ Scraped **18,983 products** (≈19,000) using Playwright from Jumia
- ✅ Covered **10 major categories × up to 50 pages** per category
- ✅ Stored results in structured **JSON** format (`data_collection/data/jumia_playwright.json`)

### ⚙️ Pipeline Features:
- Retry logic with **exponential backoff**
- Navigation timeouts and **selector-based waits**
- Tracking and skipping of timed-out pages
- Extraction of **brand**, **discount_pct**, **rating**, **reviews**, **in_stock** fields

## ⚖️ Ethical Scraping & Disclaimer

We follow these ethical guidelines for all scraping activities:
- Respect **robots.txt** and each site's **Terms of Service**
- Apply **rate limiting** and **proxy rotation** to avoid overloading servers
- Identify our scraper responsibly with a **custom User-Agent**
- Avoid collecting **personal or sensitive data**
- Comply with all applicable **legal regulations and privacy policies**

## 🧩 ETL Phase: JSON → MySQL

**ETL pipeline loads all scraped product data into a MySQL database for analytics and downstream use.**

### How it works
- Reads Jumia product data from `data_collection/data/jumia_playwright.json`
- Cleans, deduplicates, and normalizes product records
- Loads products and price history into MySQL using SQLAlchemy models (`etl/models.py`)
- Handles special characters, long text fields, and missing values robustly

### How to run
1. Ensure MySQL is running and database `price_intelligence` is created
2. Update `etl/config.py` with your MySQL credentials
3. Create tables (if not already done):
   ```bash
   python etl/create_db_tables.py
   ```
4. Run ETL pipeline:
   ```bash
   python etl/transform.py
   ```
5. Data will be loaded into `products` and `price_history` tables
